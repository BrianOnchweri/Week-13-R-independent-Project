# Kira Plastinina Online Shop Analysis

We'll get to see how we can apply unsurpervised learning algorithms in solving business case problems more specifically in marketting.

We will have two sections for this study as illustrated below:

## Part 1: Research Question
This section of the assessment covers unsupervised learning with R.
We will revisit our last week's case study and use the learnings and the given datasets. We will be tasked to create a supervised learning model to help identify which individuals are most likely to click on the ads in the blog.

The link to our last study is down below.

## Part 2: Research Question

This section of the assessment covers unsupervised learning with R.

Kira Plastinina (https://kiraplastinina.ru/) is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunctchain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia.

The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior fromdata that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

1.Perform clustering stating insights drawn from my analysis and visualizations.

2.Upon implementation, I will provide comparisons between the approaches learned this weeki.e. K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering highlighting the strengths and limitationsof each approach.
## Understanding the Data Structure

The dataset consists of 10 numerical and 8 categorical attributes. 


## Experimental Desighn

1.Problem Definition

2.Data Sourcing

3.Check the Data

4.Perform Data Cleaning

5.Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate)

6.Implement the Solution

7.Challenge the Solution
